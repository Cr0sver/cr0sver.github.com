# Privacy Policy

Introduction
Our app, **Wikiplay** (the “App”), respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any personal data we might have when you use our App. Since we do not collect or use your personal data, this policy is limited.

### Data Collection and Use
Wikiplay does not collect any personal data. This means we do not collect information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses.
* **No location-based features**: The App does not request or store your location.
* **No user accounts**: You are not required to create an account or provide personal information to use Wikiplay.
* **No analytics or tracking**: We do not track your usage or gather any analytics data.
* **No data beyond what app stores provide**: We do not collect any non-personal data beyond what is automatically provided by the App Store or Google Play to developers (e.g., aggregate installation metrics).

### Data Storage and Security
All data used by Wikiplay (such as your local game progress) is stored locally on your device. This means the data you create or input into the App is only stored on your device and is not accessible by us or any third party.

### User Rights
As a user of Wikiplay, you have full control over your device and any data saved by the App. You can uninstall the App at any time, and any locally stored data will be removed from your device.

### Policy Changes
Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated through the App (for example, via an update notice) or within our app store listing.

### Third-Party Links
Wikiplay provides curated links to Wikipedia articles. Please be aware that Wikipedia is a third-party service and has its own privacy policy. We encourage you to review Wikipedia’s privacy policy if you have any concerns about data collection on their platform.
If future updates introduce any additional third-party links, they will be clearly indicated, and those third parties may have their own privacy policies.

### Children’s Privacy
Wikiplay does not specifically target children under 13. However, it is generally safe for all ages. Please note that Wikipedia links may occasionally lead to topics that are not suitable for younger audiences. We advise parents and guardians to monitor children’s use of the App if there are any concerns.
